Blinkit Data Analysis and Dashboard Using Power BI
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit sales data and creating an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into key business metrics like total sales, average sales, average rating, number of items, fat content, item type, outlet size, and outlet location. The goal is to make the data easily interpretable, allowing users to derive actionable insights through dynamic visualizations and slicers for in-depth analysis.

Data Preprocessing
Steps Taken:

Data Cleaning:
-Removed any duplicate records.
-Handled missing values by imputing or removing them, depending on the data column's importance.
-Standardized the data format (dates, numerical values, etc.).
-Filtered out irrelevant data to ensure the analysis is focused on key performance metrics.


Data Transformation:
Created new columns for calculated metrics (e.g., total sales per item, average rating).
Transformed categorical data (e.g., item type, outlet size, and location) into a format suitable for analysis.


Data Filtering:
Filtered out outliers to ensure that extreme values donâ€™t skew the analysis.
Aggregated data by various dimensions (e.g., by item type, outlet location, etc.) for a more granular analysis.


Power BI Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard features multiple visualizations to provide insights into Blinkit sales data. Key visualizations include:


Total Sales:
A bar chart showing total sales per outlet or item type.


Average Sales:
A line graph that illustrates the average sales trend over a period.


Average Rating:
A scatter plot to show how ratings correlate with sales or number of items sold.


Number of Items Sold:
A stacked bar chart showing the number of items sold across different item types or outlet sizes.


Fat Content Analysis:
A pie chart to show the proportion of items with varying levels of fat content.


Item Type Analysis:
A slicer-based table or bar chart for analyzing the sales of different item types.


Outlet Size & Location:
A map visualization or bar chart to show how outlet size and location influence sales.


Interactive Features
Slicers
Item Type: Allows filtering based on product categories.
Outlet Size: Users can filter the data based on small, medium, or large outlets.
Location: A slicer to view data specific to a particular geographical location.
Fat Content: Filter the analysis based on low, medium, or high fat content items.
